## 🪨 Mine-Intel — Roof Fall Rate Prediction System

Mine-Intel is a machine learning–powered decision support system for predicting roof fall risk in underground mining. It trains and evaluates multiple models on historical data and uses CatBoost for accurate and reliable predictions.

The platform also includes a voice and chat-based assistant for interactive input updates and a SHAP-based analysis dashboard to explain model behavior, enabling safer and more informed mining operations.
